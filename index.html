        <h1>What the Punk?!</h1>
          <p>Street style. Anti-establishment. Edgy outfits. Alternative. All of these words are used to describe people who rebel and embrace punk fashion. </p>
          <p>Punk fashion includes clothing, hair, makeup, and jewelry. The style can change wildly from person to person, whether they are a fashion designer, band member, or your average punk.</p>
          <p>But where did the punk movement begin, and what does it really include? </p>
        <h2>Counterculture Culture</h2>
          <p>Punk fashion goes against the “norm.” The punk style first emerged in the streets of London during the mid-1970s and was highly influenced by punk rock, an aggressive style of rock music that emphasized self-expression and self-assertion. People wanted to be heard, and they were not afraid of looking or sounding gritty when doing it. </p>
          <p>Expressing one's unique identity and not conforming to rules formed the backbone of the punk movement; punk fashion was a protest. Punks were making statements about money, war, and clothing standards that shocked and offended 1970s society. </p>

      <h1>THE BIRTH OF PUNK</h1>
      <p>In the 1970s, people in Britain were experiencing mass unemployment. There were also conversations about women's rights, equality for LGBTQIA+ community, environmental crises, and conflicts like the Vietnam war around the world. As a result, punks started to dressin deliberately torn clothes, rags, and second-hand oufits. These people wanted to boldly show that something was wrong with society and that big changes had to happen. </p>

          <h2>VIVIENNE WESTWOOD</h2>
          <p>Many fashion designers started making messy, edgy clothes for the punk movement. The most famous fashion pioneer from the 1970s is Vivienne Westwood, the “mother of punk.”</p>
          <p>Vivienne Westwood worked with Malcolm McLaren to make punk more mainstream. She created  fashionable outfits with shocking graphics, rips, and belts.</p>

        <h2>PUNK GETS POPULAR</h2>
        <p>Led by Westwood and McLaren, distorted outfits with big zippers, studs, badges, and jewelry were now being used as political statements on the street. These clothes had something to say—they carried slogans, not logos.</p>
        <p>Other designers and types of clothing started to catch on, too. Musicians like the Ramones and Blondie influenced many punk trends, and brands like Levi's and Doc Martens became staples to modify and wear. The punk style of Blondie's frontwoman Debbie Harry is featured on the left. Her hair, eye makeup, and strapped shirts became iconic.</p>

      <div class="card-text">
        <h1>Why Punk!?</h1>
        <p>Punk fashion has always been about more than looks. Punk fashion was created to point out issues in society. Clothes were cut up and bought from thrift stores because many people did not have a lot of money. People also lacked opportunities, especially women and people of color, and wars were making people concerned about life.</p>
        <p>These issues sparked rebellion. Changing your clothes, hair, and style to become punk was a way of being unapologetically you and letting people know that times needed to change—whether you liked it or not!</p>

            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>Take a look at that safety pin, sword, and pair of locks! Safety pins would pin the most ravaged and torn clothing of punks. Now, this use continues, but the shape of a safety pin has been reinterpreted and worn as pairs of small earrings.</p>
            <p>Other popular forms of punk jewlery include spiked chokers, ear-to-nose chains, and elaborate rings. Some punks that dress more goth will also wear religious symbols like a cross or crown of thorns.</p>

            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>Punk accessories include belts, chains, and studs. Instead of holding up pants, belts are often worn in unusual ways as a form of rebellion. This can include bracelets, accessories on shoes, and chokers.</p>
            <p>Punk fashion is inspired by bikers and rockers, so it's not surprising that punks incorporate chains as accessories. Chains can be worn as bracelets and chokers. Studs are equally defiant. Wearing them communicates "Don't touch!"</p>
